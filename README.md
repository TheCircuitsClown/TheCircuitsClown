So, a long time ago, I was interested in SS13, specifically in Integrated Circuits of the old type, not the modern TG13 type with their limitations.
And during my time playing SS13 I have made alot of circuits, some I have shared, some were copied by ghosts (yeah they can copy ur stuff, at least used to be able to.)
Buuut I havent played SS13 in long time and aint coming back either. I would like to share all the circuits I have created to the world, of course, if someone will somehow find it.

If you found this repository, good job, use whatever you like, reverse engineer and stuff, im not coming back.
